# `transCSSR`

A Python implementation of the [Causal State Splitting Reconstruction](http://bactra.org/CSSR/) (CSSR) algorithm for inferring [epsilon-transducers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2690) from data generated by discrete-valued, discrete-time input/output systems. This page provides the full source code, released under the [GNU Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

This implementation has been tested on macOS 10.15.6, but should work on any Unix-based OS.

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ddarmon/transCSSR
```

## Graphviz

Visualization of the epsilon-machines requires [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) or similar software for reading [dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) files. To use Graphviz within a Juptyer notebook using the Anaconda distribution of Python, install the `python-graphviz` package using:

```
pip install graphviz
```


## Legacy Python 2 Version of `transCSSR`

This version of `transCSSR` is for use with Python 3.7+. A legacy version for use with Python 2.7 is hosted [here](https://github.com/ddarmon/transCSSR2).
