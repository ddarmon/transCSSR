# transCSSR

A Python implementation of the [Causal State Splitting Reconstruction](http://bactra.org/CSSR/) (CSSR) algorithm for inferring [epsilon-transducers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2690) from data generated by discrete-valued, discrete-time input/output systems. This page provides the full source code, released under the [GNU Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

This implementation has been tested on macOS 10.15.6, but should work on any Unix-based OS. It requires the following Python dependencies:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
* [scipy](http://www.scipy.org)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [igraph](http://igraph.org/python/)
* [pylab](http://wiki.scipy.org/PyLab)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)

These packages may be installed individually. A useful collection of these and related libraries for scientific computing with Python may be installed using [Enthought](https://store.enthought.com) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Visualization of the epsilon-machines requires [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) or similar software for reading [dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) files. To use Graphviz within a Juptyer notebook using the Anaconda distribution of Python, install the `python-graphviz` package using:

```
conda install python-graphviz
```

**Additional Dependencies, as of 31 July 2020:**

* [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

These can be installed using the Anaconda distribution of Python via

```
conda install -c anaconda joblib
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm
```

**NOTE:** This version of transCSSR is for use with Python 3.7+. A legacy version for use with Python 2.7 is hosted [here](https://github.com/ddarmon/transCSSR2).
